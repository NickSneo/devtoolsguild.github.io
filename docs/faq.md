# FAQs

### How are you different from Protocol Guild?

Protocol Guild (PG) is a collective funding mechanism for Ethereum layer 1 R&D and maintainers. Whilst the PG heavily inspired the DevTools Guild, the DevTools Guild exists to provide collective funding for widely used developer tooling enabling developers to easily build applications Ethereum.

### Why am I donating to projects I don’t personally use?

The DevTool Guild wants to cater for a broad and diverse range of developers. By remaining accessible to a very wide range of developers using different languages and frameworks it increases the surface area of which Ethereum can attract developers, which is key for continuing to grow the Ethereum developer community.

Diversification also mitigates against risks of over-reliance on specific tooling or teams. The removal of the [left-pad dependency from NPM](https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/) and [OpenSSL’s Heartbleed Bug](https://heartbleed.com/) are a couple of examples of widely-used libraries that resulted in high-profile industry disruption in recent years.

In addition, many of your favourite application developers likely use projects which are in the Guild behind the scenes, which translates into a better end-user experience for you.

### Why are there overlapping projects? e.g., ethers.js, viem

The number of different projects serving the JavaScript community is representative of the fact that it is the most widely used development stack for DApps. Hence it would not be fair to single out a specific project when there are multiple well-established JavaScript projects with significant user bases and communities around them.

All projects serve a substantial subset of the Ethereum developer community. Language and tooling diversity is a value of the guild

### What is required of member projects?

We want to avoid having very specific criteria which can be gamed or are subject to [Goodhart’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law). However, we do want to ensure that any potential members, like existing members of the Guild can demonstrate:

- Alignment with the DevTool Guild’s mission statement and values
- They are a public good that has a significant and likely long track record of supporting a crucial part of the Ethereum developer ecosystem
- There are individual(s) working full time on the project

### How do new projects gain membership?

There is no criteria that can guarantee access to the Guild. Until the pilot phase of the Guild (likely to run for 1 year commencing early 2025) completes, its unlikely that any new members will be accepted.

However, over the medium term, we do want to ensure that projects that can demonstrate significant positive impact to the Ethereum development community over a sustained period, who align with the mission and values of the Guild could be considered for membership by Guild members collectively.

Given we are currently bootstrapping the Guild our priority is proving that a DevTool Guild model can work over increasing the surface area of members.

### Why isn’t project *fill-in-the-blank* included?

The initial set of members includes tooling with a significant track record of serving the Ethereum development community. We may have overlooked teams, but in order for us to revisit this, we would encourage you to articulate why your project is of equal or greater importance to Ethereum developers based on the initial set of members.

### How can a project lose membership?

There are a number of ways in which this could happen, but examples could include:

- Project switches focus to a commercial model instead of remaining a common good
- Project team ceases development
- Project no longer aligns itself with the mission or values of the DevTool Guild
- Project switches focus away from Ethereum developer tooling  

### How is a Guild different from a DAO?

A guild is a member-owned advocacy organisation supporting a more abstract goal that is not specific to a particular project, but the general improvement of common goods used to create many different projects. Guilds use [rough consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus) among their members to make decisions.

DAOs are member-owned communities which utilise voting with governance tokens for decision-making among members. They are usually aligned with a particular project or protocol which they exist to govern.

### I'd like to contact the Guild, how can I do this?

You can send us a DM [via X](https://x.com/devtoolsguild).
